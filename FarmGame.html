							<p>All 3D Assets currently used in this project where designed and imported by myself using a program called magicaVoxel,
							I used this program because I liked the idea of a voxel based game and would be able to have all the
							assets I needed and they would all have matching styles to improve the look of the game and the fell of it </p>
